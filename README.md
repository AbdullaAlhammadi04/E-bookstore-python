this is an E-books Store software application meant to enhance the customer experience and streamline internal operations. 
The critical requirements for the software application are as follows:

E-book Management: The system should maintain a comprehensive catalog of the store’s available e-books. Each e-book should have detailed information such as title, author, publication date, genre, and price.
Customer Management: The system should facilitate customer information management, including personal details like (name and contact information). Customers can browse e-books online, create an account, and purchase e-books. Upon purchase, they should receive an invoice with details of the order, e-book prices, and any applicable discounts or promotions.
Shopping Cart and Orders: The system should allow customers to add e-books to their cart, remove items, or update quantities. Orders should reflect the number of e-books and order date. E-books are delivered instantly upon purchase completion.
Discounts and Pricing: The system should support flexible pricing and discount options. The e-book store’s loyalty program members receive a 10% discount on all purchases, and bulk purchases (5 or more e-books in a single order) receive a 20% discount.
Payment and Invoicing: Each order should generate an invoice detailing the itemized price, applicable discounts, and the final total. Value-added Taxes (VAT) at a fixed rate of 8% are applied to all purchases.
